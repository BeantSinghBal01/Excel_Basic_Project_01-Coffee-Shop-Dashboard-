# Excel_Basic_Project_01-Coffee-Shop-Dashboard-<br>
# There is an attached excel file.
This is my first basic excel project. Let's talk about this project, I act as a franchise owner at "Maven Roasters", a coffee shop chain with three location in New York City.<br>For understanding the purchase behavior &amp; streamline operations, I collected transactional data from Jan,2023 to Jun,2023.<br>
<br>
The **source of dataset** is :https://app.mavenanalytics.io/
<br>
**#Object of this Projects are following:**<br>
<br>
****OBJECTIVE 01****<br>
To Prepare the data for analysis the first objective is **to explore the coffee shop dataset**, conduct some basic data QA and profiling, and add calculated date and time fields to prepare the data for analysis.<br>
**The Task to fulfill the objective 01**<br>
1. Take a moment to **familiarize yourself with the data**. How many transactions were recorded, over what period of time? What products and product categories were sold? <br>
2. **Add** a **new column** to calculate **Revenue (price * quantity)**<br>**Add new columns** to **calculate Month and Day of Week** based on the transaction date (BONUS: display them as text (ie “Jan”, “Feb”, “Sun”, “Mon”), instead of numerical values)<br>
3.**Add a new column to extract Hour from the transaction time**
<br>
****THE OBJECTIVE 02****<br>
**Explore the data with Pivot Tables**<br>
Second objective is to slice and dice the coffee shop data with Excel PivotTables, and create views to analyze time series and product-level trends.The **tasks** are following:<br>
**1.** Insert a PivotTable on a new tab to show revenue by month**<br>
**2.** Add two more PivotTables (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by day of week and by hour of day<br>
**3.** Add a PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by product category, sorted descending by transactions<br>
**4.** Add a PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions and revenue by product type, sorted descending and filtered to the Top 15 (by transactions).<br>
<br>
****THE OBJECTIVE 03****<br>
**Build a dynamic dashboard**<br>
Your final objective is to visualize the data with Pivot Charts, design an interactive dashboard, and identify insights and recommendations for the coffee shop. the Tasks are following:<br>
**1.** Add Pivot Charts to show revenue by month as a line chart, transactions by day of week and hour of day as column charts, and transactions by product category as a bar chart.<br>
**2.** Assemble the charts into a rough dashboard layout, and include space for the PivotTable showing Top 15 product types (you can design your own layout, or follow the solution)**.<br>
**3.** Add a slicer for store location, and connect it to all of the PivotTables on the sheet**.<br>
**4.** Adjust formatting, alignment and polish to finalize the dashboard (TIP: hide the raw PivotTables and remove the worksheet gridlines).<br>
**5.** Do you notice any interesting patterns or trends? What recommendations might you offer to improve Maven Roasters operations?.<br>
<br>
